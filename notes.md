Here are some examples I can think of.

Let m be any natural number, and let a,b,c,d be any integers. Then:

≡ modulo m is an equivalence relation. That is,
a≡amodm.
If a≡bmodm, then b≡amodm.
If a≡bmodm and b≡cmodm, then a≡cmodm.
Addition and multiplication are well-defined modulo m. That is,
If a≡bmodm and c≡dmodm, then a+c≡b+dmodm, and ac≡bdmodm.
If ac≡bcmodmc, then a≡bmodm.
The congruence ax≡bmodm has solutions (i.e., integers x making the statement true) if and only if gcd(a,m) divides b.

If p is a prime and 1≤k≤p−1, then the binomial coefficient (pk) satisfies (pk)≡0modp.
Fermat's little theorem, and its generalization, Euler's theorem
There are primitive roots modulo m if and only if m=pk or m=2pk where p is an odd prime number, or if m=2 or m=4.
